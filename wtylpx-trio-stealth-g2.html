                            <p> I know my way around Android a bit but I've come up against a roadblock with my latest low-end tablet purchase. For some reason when I turn it on now it gets stuck at the bootload screen. I tried to do a factory restore (tablet is unrooted with stock rom) and when it starts to restore it gets stuck and will go no further. When I contacted the maker's tech support, they told me to do exactly what I had already tried.factory restore. Is there some way I can get my tablet running again through.

My father asked me to look for a quality tablet for him this Thanksgiving. I've searched up on Walmart first and have found a few tablets that seemed okay but then there's the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 for 0. The Tab would be almost double the others but it seems more trustworthy in the aspect of avoiding. Hello. So, I am an iOS user (I have a Mac desktop and an iPad) however I was gifted an Android tablet. It is an 8GB Trio Stealth G2. I would like to put it to use but I am not familiar with its capabilities. I am looking for advice on useful apps that would be different from my iPad, or similar, doesn't matter. I would rather use it than it waste away in my closet. Before you suggest I sell it, I would rather explore the tablet's potential before considering that route. Thank. I have tried using the reset button, have tried to go into recovery mode. When I am supposed to go into recovery mode I simply get a black screen instead of all the options I should (However, the backlight is still on).

It is a very basic tablet but I would still like to root it. It does run android 4.0 by the way. I have rooted my phones in the past but any root software I try to use says that the device could not be found. I tried finding a solution to the tablet not being recognized as an android device but i could not get any of the solutions to actually work. Does anyone know how to help? My computer runs windows 7 home premium. 
I'm a college student and I absolutely love using a stylus to take handwritten notes. However, I have come across the issue several times in terms of screen size because I can only use my phone to accurately take notes. I have a tablet, however the touch is terribly inaccurate (it's a G2 Stealth Trio) and I am unable to take handwritten notes on it. So, my question is what is the cause of poor touch accuracy? I feel like it is probably linked to resolution. Also, has anyone had any good experien. Web Design by Creation Seven Limited Co.
