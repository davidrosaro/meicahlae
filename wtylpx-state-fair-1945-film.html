It is a 28-page essay examining Tony Stark's journey from Iron Man to Endgame  It is a literal wall of text, so proceed with caution (: Greetings, fellow Marvel fans! Ever since I wrote my essay on Thanos (https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/8gtlin/thanos_the_messianic_hero_an_academic_exposition/) after the release of Avengers: Infinity War , I have been contemplating a series of academic essays on diffe.

On this post, I will focus on Warner Bros, probably the most consistently successful studio of all time with a ton of properties in their hands (most likely way more than Disney).

United Artists was later bought out by MGM. UA’s Pre-1952 films and MGM’s Pre-1986 films were bought out by Turner Broadcasting System, which later merged.

I'm making another timeline post, but this time all my evidence is ripped straight out of the screenplays. I searched through every script of every MCU film looking for specific dates and searching words that relate to the passage of time such as: "years", "months", "weeks", and "days".

I am 84 years old, having been born on July 19th, 1917. I was in the Tank Destroyer Unit, I guess you could call it an Armored Unit, and we were attached to the Fifth Infantry Division, and later on to the 26th Infantry Division during World War II. I would eventually be discharged as a Private First Class, but I had other ranks during my several years of service. However that is the way I was discharged Since my comment thread was brought up on stream briefly, I wish to reply to two comments made by Destiny afterwards when discussing the topic. This is a very, very long thread. I was referred to the VOD where a comment thread I started was brought up on stream. Destiny provided some pointers to people on his side of the debate.

Today I will be digging into one particularly egregious piece of bad history known as Hitler's War: What Historians Neglect to Mention. Link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mA0kk29DBAamplist=WLampindex=1 So as a preface I figure I should provide a few bits of context. Hitler’s War: What Historians Neglect to Mention is an English translation of Alphart Geyer’s film Hitlers Krieg? Was Guido Knopp Verschweigt. The translation was done by Justice4Germans (Yeah Alright everybody welcome to Part 3 of the All-Time Teams.

It's that time of year once again: the Army–Navy Game is upon us! One of college football's legendary rivalries, the two service academies have seen their share of cadets and midshipmen make it into the NFL. While such a task has become much more difficult in recent times due to various rulings by the Department of Defense, it's still not impossible to see a Black Knight or Midshipman on an NFL roster. To celebrate the game, I have written a two-part series on Army/Navy graduates and former.
